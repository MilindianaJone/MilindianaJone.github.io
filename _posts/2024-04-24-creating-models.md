# Deep Learning Model Generation

{:toc}

During the past few weeks, I have learnt how models can be generated using deep learning techniques, and even made my own using the CIFAR10 dataset. 

## Downloading using DuckDuckGo

The duckduckgo_search package was effective in being able to scrape the web for a lot of images. However, I did note that this procedure was time consuming, and trying to collect 200 images each for 10 different classes took me 22 minutes to complete.

## Image Classification

General preformatted text:

    # Do a thing
    do_thing()

Python code and output:

```python
# Prints '2'
print(1+1)
```
    2


## t-SNE plots



## Confusion Matrices
